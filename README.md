Project Title : mstring.h

Description :
I have tried to implement functions from string.h header file and my version is named as mstring.h
I have implemented 20 functions from the standard header file namely : mstrlen(), mstrdup(), mstrtok(), mstrlwr(), mstrupr(), mstrrev(), mstrcat(), mstrstr(), mstrrstr(), mstrcmp(), mstrcmpi(), mstrcpy(), mstrnlen(), mstrchr(), mstrrchr(), mstrncat(), mstrncpy(), mstrset(), mmemset(), mmemcpy()
I have used character pointers for accomplishing the task. 
For testing purpose, I have prepared testcases by considering various possible combinations of inputs.
Then by reading that testcase file, comparing the expected and calculated result, displaying the conclusion whether the test case is PASS or FAIL.
